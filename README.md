# **Countdown Carnage**

*A Timed FPS Shooter | Developed in Unreal Engine 5*

---

## **Overview**

*Countdown Carnage* is a fast-paced first-person shooter where players battle waves of flying drones in a dark, dystopian city. The game features a dynamic combat system, intelligent drone AI, and timed gameplay mechanics where every kill extends the countdown timer. Developed entirely in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints, this project showcases my proficiency in AI programming, combat mechanics, and user interface design.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic FPS Combat**
Engage in thrilling first-person combat with a variety of weapons against aggressive drones. The combat mechanics are designed to feel responsive, fluid, and intense.

- **Intelligent Drone AI**
The drones utilize Behavior Trees for patrol, chase, and attack logic. They actively track the player, becoming more aggressive as the player is detected or attacks them.

- **Timed Gameplay Mechanics**
Players must clear all drones within a set time limit. Each drone kill extends the timer, adding tension and excitement as the countdown clock ticks away.

- **Resource Management**
Players can collect health and ammo pickups scattered across the environment, which are essential for surviving the drone onslaught.

- **User Interface (UI)**
The HUD includes a countdown timer, health bar, and score indicator, providing real-time feedback to the player and enhancing gameplay immersion.

- **Particle Effects & Sounds**
High-quality particle effects and sound design make every shot and explosion feel impactful, with dynamic audio that intensifies the action.
